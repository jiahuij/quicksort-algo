# quicksort-algo

 a programin VS C++2017to implement the quicksort algorithm shown in class (either the Lomuto's algorithm or the Hoare's algorithm). Thelist of integers to be sorted in nondecreasing ordershould be stored in a file namedp2data.txt, where each line contains exactly one integer. Since the number of integers in the file is unknown, you should useeither vectors orthe dynamic array approach shown in class to handle them.Once the list of integers is sorted in nondecreasing order, display them to the screen with each line containing exactly one integer.
